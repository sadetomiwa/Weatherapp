Using the Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/) create a weather application that, at a minimum, displays the Curent Temperature, Feels Like Temperature, and Condtion using JavaScript.

You will need to get the data from an API from weatherapi.com. Sign up for a new account, and you will be given an API key which will authenticate and allow you access to the data.

(Creative freedom is encouraged here)

Once the project is complete, commit the project to github and submit the github repository link to the assignment.
